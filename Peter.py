"""Produce a solution to Python to as many of these challenegs as you can

One challenge is already implemented so you can get get the idea (not
that it's difficult...). You can look up as much as you like on the internet
but I will expect you to understand the code you implement, so don't just
Cargo Cult it.

There are two aspects to the result:

1) That it passes the test (the "Engineer's" result)
2) That it does is elegantly, efficiently and perhaps interestingly (the "Programmer's" result)

NB Your solution has to return the result, not just print it!
